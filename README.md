# <center>Slug It!</center>

## <center> Slug generator created with [bulma](https://bulma.io) and [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev). :evergreen_tree: </center>

---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have created this simple slug generator simple to have try out alpine.js and have a little bit of fun with this tiny JavaScript "framework".

#### [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is written in single html file. I admit, that it can get a pretty messy pretty fast, but for small application alpine.js is great choice. :thumbsup:

#### [Bulma](https://bulma.io)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For styling I used Bulma, which again is small and simple but powerful css framework. It is super customizable, looks beautiful and amazingly **just** work :wink:

### Hudles

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not able to implement all of my custom styling with alpine. I had to create separate `<style>` for custom css styling, that was not provided with bulma. My goal was to be able to add custom classes to elements, but have defined those classes in the Apline code itself, or something amond those lines...:fast_forward: To be able to delete `<style>` and have all of my custom css in apline code and be able to access it *"globaly"*.

####Ideas are welcomed :smile:
